🎯 Objective

This project aims to build an AI system that evaluates the trustworthiness and sentiment of a product or website based on real online reviews.
It helps users quickly understand whether a product is reliable, popular, or potentially risky before making a purchase decision.

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters a product name or website URL.

The app retrieves or simulates customer reviews for that product.

Reviews are analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Based on the results, the system generates a Trust Score (0–100%) and a recommendation message such as:

✅ Safe to Buy

⚠️ Be Cautious

❌ Not Recommended

🌟 Key Features

AI Sentiment Analysis – Understands tone and emotion in customer reviews.

Trust Score Generator – Calculates how trustworthy a product appears based on sentiment.
